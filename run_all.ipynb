    "# NAS-BNN Full Pipeline for WakeVision Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook orchestrates the entire NAS-BNN pipeline for the WakeVision dataset (person detection).\n",
    "It includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "0.  Data Preparation (`prepare_local_wake_vision_from_csv.py`)\n",
    "0.5. Supernet OPs Range Check (`check_ops.py`)\n",
    "1.  Supernet Training (`train.py`)\n",
    "2.  Evolutionary Architecture Search (`search.py`)\n",
    "2.5. Inspection of Search Results (Manual Step Placeholder)\n",
    "3.  Testing of Searched Architectures (`test.py`)\n",
    "4.  Fine-tuning of Searched Architectures (`train_single.py`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset Evolution:** This pipeline was originally developed for ImageNet, adapted for CIFAR-10, and is now configured for WakeVision dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Notes Before Running:**\n",
    "*   Ensure your Python environment (e.g., `nasbnn`) is selected as the kernel for this notebook.\n",
    "*   It's recommended to set the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable in the terminal *before* launching Jupyter Lab/Notebook for consistent GPU selection by PyTorch, e.g., `set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0` (cmd) or `$env:CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=\"0\"` (PowerShell). While we try to set it in the first code cell, its effect on `!` shell commands can sometimes be limited to that cell.\n",
    "*   The script uses placeholder values for OPs ranges and keys to test/finetune. You will be prompted to review/update these after certain steps. For a fully automated run without intervention, you would need to pre-set these accurately.\n",
    "*   Long-running cells (especially Supernet Training and Search) are generally more robustly run from standalone scripts in a terminal. This notebook is primarily for demonstration and step-by-step execution."
